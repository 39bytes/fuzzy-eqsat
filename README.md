# fuzzy-eqsat

Experimenting with approximations and equality saturation for linear algebra using [egg](https://github.com/egraphs-good/egg).

## Running experiments
If you have `just` installed:

```
just run
```

This will run the equality saturation and output some data to the `experiments/` directory.

## Notes
This project was done for the class COMP 400: Honours Research Project at McGill University.
