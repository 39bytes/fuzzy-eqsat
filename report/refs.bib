  abstract = {An e-graph efficiently represents a congruence relation over many
              expressions. Although they were originally developed in the late
              1970s for use in automated theorem provers, a more recent technique
              known as equality saturation repurposes e-graphs to implement
              state-of-the-art, rewrite-driven compiler optimizations and program
              synthesizers. However, e-graphs remain unspecialized for this newer
              use case. Equality saturation workloads exhibit distinct
              characteristics and often require ad-hoc e-graph extensions to
              incorporate transformations beyond purely syntactic rewrites. This
              work contributes two techniques that make e-graphs fast and
              extensible, specializing them to equality saturation. A new
              amortized invariant restoration technique called rebuilding takes
              advantage of equality saturation's distinct workload, providing
              asymptotic speedups over current techniques in practice. A general
              mechanism called e-class analyses integrates domain-specific
              analyses into the e-graph, reducing the need for ad hoc
              manipulation. We implemented these techniques in a new open-source
              library called egg. Our case studies on three previously published
              applications of equality saturation highlight how egg's performance
              and flexibility enable state-of-the-art results across diverse
              domains.},
