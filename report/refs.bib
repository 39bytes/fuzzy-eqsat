  abstract = {An e-graph efficiently represents a congruence relation over many
              expressions. Although they were originally developed in the late
              1970s for use in automated theorem provers, a more recent technique
              known as equality saturation repurposes e-graphs to implement
              state-of-the-art, rewrite-driven compiler optimizations and program
              synthesizers. However, e-graphs remain unspecialized for this newer
              use case. Equality saturation workloads exhibit distinct
              characteristics and often require ad-hoc e-graph extensions to
              incorporate transformations beyond purely syntactic rewrites. This
              work contributes two techniques that make e-graphs fast and
              extensible, specializing them to equality saturation. A new
              amortized invariant restoration technique called rebuilding takes
              advantage of equality saturation's distinct workload, providing
              asymptotic speedups over current techniques in practice. A general
              mechanism called e-class analyses integrates domain-specific
              analyses into the e-graph, reducing the need for ad hoc
              manipulation. We implemented these techniques in a new open-source
              library called egg. Our case studies on three previously published
              applications of equality saturation highlight how egg's performance
              and flexibility enable state-of-the-art results across diverse
              domains.},

  abstract = { A simple nonrecursive form of the tensor decomposition in d
              dimensions is presented. It does not inherently suffer from the
              curse of dimensionality, it has asymptotically the same number of
              parameters as the canonical decomposition, but it is stable and its
              computation is based on low-rank approximation of auxiliary
              unfolding matrices. The new form gives a clear and convenient way
              to implement all basic operations efficiently. A fast rounding
              procedure is presented, as well as basic linear algebra operations.
              Examples showing the benefits of the decomposition are given, and
              the efficiency is demonstrated by the computation of the smallest
              eigenvalue of a 19-dimensional operator. },
